#### FizzBuzz

Tom Scott explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc

--> Create a game in python that outputs the children's game FizzBuzz.

1. Every player returns a number in order (e.g. 1, 2 ...)
2. On multiples of 3, player says "Fizz" instead of "3"
3. On mulitples of 5, player says "Buzz" instead of "5"
4. On multiples of both 3 and 5, player says "FizzBuzz"
5. Continue.

Output these numbers with the FizzBuzz substitutions up to 100.
